 Web Scraping using Microsoft Excel VBA


This file contains a VBA macro that scrapes sales data from a website and imports it into an Excel worksheet. The macro uses the Internet Explorer object to navigate to the website, extract the data from the HTML elements, and copy it to the worksheet. The macro also formats the data and creates a pivot table and a chart to summarize the sales information. The file includes comments to explain the code and instructions on how to run the macro.
